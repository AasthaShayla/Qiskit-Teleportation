# Qiskit-Teleportation
Quantum Teleportation algorithm with Basic of QC
QISKit is the software that sits between quantum algorithms from one side,
and the physical quantum device from the other. It translates common 
programming languages like Python into quantum machine language. 
This means anyone outside of the IBM Q lab can program a quantum computer.
